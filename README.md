# About

utftp is a C library and an application implementing the *T*rivial *F*ile *T*ransfer *P*rotocol.

The application was supposed to serve only as an example for the library but since .
I feel the world still lacks a implementation for TFTP that doesn't accidentally send its log output on the UDP socket, refuse to serve symlinks, or mangle file names.
